# tamber-react-demo
Tamber Recommendations Demo App

Follow the [quick start guide here][quickstart] to setup your Tamber engine and seed it with ProductHunt events data.

## Install

`cd` in to the tamber-react-demo directory and run:

```sh
npm install
```

## Build

While the install is completing, open `keys.js` and set the `ProjectKey` and `EngineKey` fields to match the engine you created in the [setup guide][quickstart].

Once install is complete and your keys have been set, run `watchify` to build the app:

```sh
npm start
```
Note: As long as `watchify` is running, it will automatically rebuild the app whenever you edit a file â€“ so feel free to dig into the code and experiment.

## Run

Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice (Chrome is recommended) and have fun!
